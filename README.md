Week 3's tech educators coding assignment

## How to use

- Click the cat to pet him, gaining 1 pet each time!
- buy upgrades using the pets to earn automatic pets!
- clear your stats with the clear stats button

## What Went well

- I made a wireframe and was able to replicate in, the wireframe can be found in the assets folder

- i fetched the data from the API and used to for the prices and increase to the per sec interval

- I was able to use functions effectively to keep code organised

- used event listeners for the buttons and cat image to count the clicks

- used local storage to store the data

- the count updates after every second, and also when you click the cat or buy a store item

- im happy with the media query for switching between desktop and mobile view, both look nice and work well

- ============== extras

- To my knowledge i used a single function to handle the store, getting it to loop for the length of the array

- inlcuded an animation for that cat and shows interaction when clicking the cat as well

- A how to use in the read me file

## what Went Not so well

- Im not too sure how i could change and update the array i was getting from the API, i just made my own array for the names and used that instead. but for example if I wanted to change the shop cost each time i bought it and save it I would have to edit the api, and then store it in local storage and also make to so it now uses the local storage value rather than the api one, I wasnt sure how to do this. I did research around it but couldnt find a good enought example becuase the ones i found kept involving the array in the actual code rather than they were getting it from an api each time. I was wondering if you could give me an example on how to do this.

- I should of factored in making a settings menu early on, it was a bit annoying try to make a menu so late in the development so in the end i decided not to. I need to have a look at how to make it so menus pop up and disappear too.

- I think how I went about getting my layout, although it works, is a bit messy. Because of this it was a pain to try and implement something new like a settings menu button. I few things I wanted to move around werent playing nice either like trying to get the cat more centre but the title higher up, but in the end I think it looks good how it is. I'm just nitpicking a little bit here.
